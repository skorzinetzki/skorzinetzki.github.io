I am working as a software developer at [lise GmbH in Cologne, Germany][lise-gmbh], which is also my homebase. There, I am developing mainly with Microsoft .NET technology, but have also some experience in Java and PHP. I am an advocate of agile software development and continuous delivery. My favourite quotes are the following, which reminds me (and my team) of limiting the work in progress (e.g. like in Kanban) and agile/lean principles:

> Stop starting, start finishing! - (author unknown)
> There is nothing quite so useless, as doing with great efficiency, something that should not be done at all. â€• Peter F. Drucker
