I am working as a software developer at [lise GmbH in Cologne, Germany][lise-gmbh], which is also my homebase. There, I am developing mainly with Microsoft .NET technology, but have also some experience in Java and PHP. I am an advocate of agile software development and continuous delivery. My favourite quote is the following, which reminds me (and my team) of limiting the work in progress (e.g. like in Kanban):

> Stop starting, start finishing!
